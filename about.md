# About Me

Write this like a tight “professional summary”:
- What you do
- What environments you’ve supported (office, production, labs, etc.)
- What you deliver (reliability, standardization, documentation, reduced downtime)

## What I’m looking for
Roles, industries, location/remote, and the kind of work you enjoy most.

## Strengths
- Clear documentation
- Practical troubleshooting
- Delivery focus (ship improvements, reduce risk, keep systems stable)
